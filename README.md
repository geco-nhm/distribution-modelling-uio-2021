You can do this either by the command line or through the [GitHub Desktop](https://desktop.github.com/) application  
2. Get familiar with the folder structure
3. Download spatial data before the first lab through the link [here](https://uio-my.sharepoint.com/:f:/g/personal/peterhor_uio_no/EjbrdH5bzjVLmWyz7JVVxhkB9vluk4RznDJbxmY54hKVsw?e=UelRxa)
