# The students are split into groups that will address effects of
# ONE of these data properties (see notes on data etc. for each
# theme below):
# 1. Extent of study area
# 2. Grain of study area
# 3. Density of presence points
# 4. Clumping of presence points

# Each person in the group works with a different species, and addresses
# the following questions:
# How does extent/resolution/density/clumping [ONE of these] affect
# a. Observed response frequencies
# b. Environmental variable covariation
# c. Model structure (selected environmental variables) 
# d. Modelled response curves (for selected environmental variables)
# e. Model predictions (spatial predictions, AUC)

# Compare around the table: how do results for different species compare?
# How/why do they differ?

# Make a presentation (about 10 min in total) of individual results
# (2 mins per person), as well as summary across the group (2 mins).

# Species list (one per person):
# ------------------------------
# Amur maple (sibirl√∏nn) - Acer ginnala
# Hungarian lilac (ungarsk syrin) - Syringa josikaea
# American mink (mink) - Neovison vison
# Humpback (pukkellaks) - Oncorhynchus gorbuscha
# Common Pheasant (fasan) - Phasianus colchicus

# Theme 1: EXTENT
#################

# You will work with three extents:
# 1. All of Norway
# 2. Southern or northern Norway (depending on distribution of species)
# 3. South-eastern or south-western Norway (depending on species, but extent may not be appropriate for all species)

# Here is the task in words:

# First, download a data set of occurrences for your species from GBIF.
# Then, for each extent, do the following:
# - Load predictor rasters (2km resolution) for the appropriate extent (modify paths and raster stack names as needed)
# - Generate a training data set based on the occurrences and the predictor rasters
# - Fit an appropriate distribution model and assess it with respect to a-e above

# Here is some draft code:

# Download GBIF data
# key <- name_backbone(name= [WRITE YOUR SPECIES NAME HERE], kingdom= [WRITE THE APPROPORIATE KINGDOM HERE])$speciesKey
 key <- name_backbone(name= "Acer ginnala", kingdom="Plantae")$speciesKey
# key <- name_backbone(name= "Syringa josikaea", kingdom="Plantae")$speciesKey
# key <- name_backbone(name= "Neovison vison", kingdom="Animalia")$speciesKey
# key <- name_backbone(name= "Oncorhyncus gorbuscha", kingdom="Animalia")$speciesKey
# key <- name_backbone(name= "Phasianus colchincus", kingdom="Animalia")$speciesKey
sp <- occ_search(taxonKey=key, hasCoordinate=TRUE, country="NO", limit=1000)

# Modify and repeat the following for all three extents:

# Load environmental predictor data as rasters
# r.list <- list.files("lab_data/RTPD/TIFF_EXTENT/NORWAY", pattern="tif$", full.names=TRUE)
r.list <- list.files("lab_data/RTPD/TIFF_GRAIN/2km", pattern="tif$", full.names=TRUE)
predictors.Norway <- stack(r.list)

# Generate training data for your species for the particular extent
training.data.Norway <- generate.training.data(sp,predictors.Norway,generate.absences=TRUE,absence.value=NA,n.abs=1000,factors=c("artype","norge123"))   # To see how the function 'generate.training.data' works, open the file 'Dataprep.functions.r'

# Inspect the data, select an appropriate distribution modelling method,
# fit a model, evaluate it and collect the information you need to answer the questions a-e above.
# Reuse code from other labs!

# Make sure to store the results/plots for each extent before you move on
# to the next, so that you can compare results across extents (i.e. answer the questions a-e above).

# Join with the others in your group to make a presentation of the results,
# as described above.
