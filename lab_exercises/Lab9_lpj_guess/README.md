# Lab 09 - Dynamic Global Vegetation Models (DGVM) - LPJ-GUESS Education

**Please read this carefully!**

In this exercise, we will use LPJ-GUESS Education to learn how Dynamic Global Vegetation Models (DGVMs) work.
The freely available software includes a Graphical User Interface (GUI), which makes setting up model simulations less
technically challenging. [Click here](https://web.nateko.lu.se/lpj-guess/education/) to find all the relevant documentation.

**Obs!** To avoid version mismatches, please use the installer (`LPJGE.msi`) contained in this repository in the
`./installation_file/` directory to install the program on your Windows machine! It's no problem if you do not have a Windows 
OS at your disposal, we will pair you up with someone who does during the lab to make sure everyone can participate.

The interactive exercise materials and instructions can be found here:

that we can use your input to improve the materials!

## Functionally Assembled Terrestrial Ecosystem Simulator (FATES)

If you finish the exercise early and feel motivated to run a different DGVM, please follow [this link](https://training.galaxyproject.org/training-material/topics/climate/tutorials/fates/tutorial.html). The tutorial will introduce you to running the FATES model (see lecture) with the help of a GUI and the computational resources provided by the GALAXY project ([see wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Galaxy_(computational_biology)). You can access the resources here: [](https://climate.usegalaxy.eu/) - note that you will need to register a user account.
